########################
|EC2| Instances Examples
########################

You can access the features of |EC2| using the |sdk-net|. For example, you can create, start, and
terminate |EC2| instances.

The sample code is written in C#, but you can use the |sdk-net| with any compatible
language. When you install the |TVSlong| a set of C# project templates are installed. So the easiest
way to start this project is to open Visual Studio, and then choose :guilabel:`File`, :guilabel:`New Project`,
:guilabel:`AWS Sample Projects`, :guilabel:`Compute and Networking`,
:guilabel:`AWS EC2 Sample`.

Testing with Visual Studio 2013 after installing AWS SDK for .Net - these projects are not available.
There are only 2 options: AWS CloudFormation Project, AWS Lambda Function Project (Node.js)
The first one looks promising, giving a wide range of options, but generates only a config file - no code.
This appears to be in-development, and of no use to developers.


Prerequisites
=============

Before you begin, be sure that you have created an AWS account and set up your AWS credentials. For
more information, see :ref:`net-dg-setup`.
